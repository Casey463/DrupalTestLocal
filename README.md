# Drupal - Test
* React App with Drupal 10 Backend designed for the Genexy Health Organization as a proof of concept test replacement for soon to be retired Drupal 7 structure
* Uses DDEV as a test environment to manage the multiple containers needed for this app.
* Allows for real time translation of the entire app using the React Auto Translate through Google API
* Uses standard React-Context for data management and a hook-based architecture, and MUI plugins for a simple but effective UI design.
